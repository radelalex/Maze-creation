# Maze-creation

This is some stuff I did as a child with a pen on cross-section paper!
So I first decided for a pattern, like 3 strokes up (from the lower left corner to the upper right) and 2 strokes down (from the upper left corner to the lower right). Then I took a point in the center of the sheet of paper and start to draw that pattern anti-clockwise and repeat that. After some time mazes are created only depending on the initial pattern.

This simulation creates those patterns :)
